The goal of this course is to provide an overview of cloud computing, including theoretical principles (deployment models, virtualization, storage, etc.) and an overview of available open-source technologies facilitating the development of cloud services. Apart from the lectures there are invited presentations from experts from various IT companies. This way students get a first-hand experience of how cloud computing is used in the private sector.
